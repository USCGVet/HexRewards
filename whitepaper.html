            <h2>HexRewards - A Rewarding Experience for Hex Stakers</h2>
            <h2>Introduction (NOTE: this white paper is a work in progress.)</h2>
    <p>
        HexRewards is an innovative smart contract designed to provide additional 
        incentives for Hex stakers. By leveraging the power of the Hex staking system, 
        HexRewards offers a unique opportunity for users to earn additional rewards 
        based on their staking length of time. This white paper will explore the key 
        features and benefits of the HexRewards contract, providing a comprehensive 
        overview for potential users.
    </p>

    <h2>Registering - (Stake Claiming) - "New" Stakes Only</h2>
    <h3>2.1 Stake ID Protection</h3>
    <p>
        To ensure the integrity of the rewarding system, HexRewards implements 
        a stake ID protection mechanism. "New" stakes with a stakeID greater than 
        the STAKEID_PROTECTION value (817340) are eligible for claiming rewards 
        only after "Registering". This protection helps prevent abuse and ensures 
        that the supply of the token doesn't grow infinitly. "Old" active stakes 
        that have a stakeID lower than or equal to 817340 are eligible for 
        claiming rewards without the need of "Registering" first.
    </p>

    <h3>2.2 Stake Tiers</h3>
    <p>
        HexRewards introduces a tiered system based on the amount of Hex staked for 
        "New" stakes with a stake ID after the STAKEID_PROTECTION value (817340). 
        There are nine tiers, each with a maximum number of stakes allowed 
        (MAX_STAKES_PER_TIER = 369). The 9 tiers also have a Hex Stake Size requirement.
        Users can claim their stake by clicking on the 
        "Register" button on the site which then calls the claimStake function in 
        the contract, providing their stake index. The contract will determine the 
        appropriate tier based on the Hex staked amount and register the stake accordingly 
        consuming one of the available seats or slots of that tier. Once a tier has 
        been consumed, where all the seats are "Registered" for that tier, then no 
        more stakes can be "Registered" for that tier.
    </p>

    <h2>Reward Calculation</h2>
    <h3>3.1 Reward Per Day</h3>
    <p>
        The contract defines a constant REWARD_PER_DAY = 0.00001 HXR, which represents 
        the base reward amount earned per day of staking. The actual reward earned 
        depends on the duration of the stake and whether it is a 5555-day stake or not.
    </p>

    <h3>3.2 5555-Day Stakes</h3>
    <p>
        For active stakes with a duration of 5555 days (MAX_STAKE_DAYS), the reward per day 
        is multiplied by a factor of 10. If the 5555 day stake has finished all 5555 
        days, the user is to go to the Hex website and call the "Good Accounting" function to 
        show the stake has completed its term. Then the normal reward per day for HXR is multiplied by 
        a factor of 100 when "Claimed".
    </p>

    <h3>3.3 Stakes Fewer Than 5555 Days</h3>
    <p>
        For stakes with a duration less than 5555 days, the reward per day remains unchanged 
        if the stake is still active. If the stake has finished all days for the stake, the 
        user is to go to the Hex website and call the "Good Accounting" function to prove the 
        stake has completed its term. Then the reward per day of HXR is multiplied by a factor of 10 
        when "Claimed".
    </p>

    <h2>Reward Claiming</h2>
    <h3>4.1 Claiming Rewards</h3>
    <p>
        Users can claim their rewards by calling the claimReward function at any time while the stake is 
        active. The contract checks if the stake is eligible for rewards and calculates the reward amount 
        based on the consumed days and stake duration. The reward is then minted to the user's address, 
        and the claimed amount is recorded in the claimed mapping.

        If the user ends the stake on the Hex website, or calls the "Emergency End Stake" function, 
        the HXR contract will not be able to find that Hex stake anymore and will not be able to 
        reward that Hex stake any HXR tokens.
    </p>

    <h3>4.2 Hex Stake "Good Accounting" for 10x HXR Bonus Reward</h3>
    <p>
        When the Hex stake has reached the full term of the stake, the user is to go to the Hex website 
        and call the "Good Accounting" function to show the stake has completed its term. Then the user
        can call the claimReward function in the HXR contract to claim the 10x bonus reward. The reward
        is then minted to the user's address, and the claimed amount is recorded in the claimed mapping.

        If the user ends the stake on the Hex website, or calls the "Emergency End Stake" function, or 
        ends the stake before claiming the HXR reward, the HXR contract will not be able to find
        that Hex stake anymore and will not be able to reward that Hex stake any HXR tokens.
    </p>

    <h3>4.3 Returning Rewards</h3>
    <p>
        The Return function in the HexRewards contract allows users to return their previously claimed rewards in exchange for  
        higher rewards at a later date. By returning the claimed rewards along with an additional fee, users can re-activate their stake 
        and accumulate more HXR tokens based on the extended time their stake has been active. This feature provides flexibility, enabling users 
        to optimize their reward strategy based on their stake progress and investment goals.  Be mindful of the agressiveness of the fee.
        The fee is calculated by looking at the current number of days you've already consumed, then it multiplies that number of days times
        the daily HXR reward amount and adds an additional 30% on top. As long as you call the return function within the timeframe of your Hex stake, 
        the total return amount should always be less than 1/10th the Good Accounting Reward 10x bonus.
    </p>
    <!-- Example of Returning Rewards for a Standard Stake -->
    <div class="example">
        <h2>Example:</h2>
        <h3>Returning Rewards for a Standard Non-5555 Day Stake</h3>
        <p><strong>Stake Duration:</strong> 1000 days</p>
        <h4>Initial Claim</h4>
        <p>You claim rewards at day 100 of your 1000-day stake, receiving 0.001 HXR calculated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> 100 days consumed of stake × 0.00001 HXR/day = 0.001 HXR</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Return the same day that you claimed:</h4>
        <p>You decide to return the claim on the same day you claimed, you return 0.0013 HXR:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> (100 days consumed of stake) × 0.00001 HXR/day = 0.001 HXR + (30% of 0.001 HXR) = 0.0013 HXR</li>
            <li><strong>Return Amount:</strong> 0.001 HXR + (30% of 0.001 HXR) = 0.0013 HXR</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Return 100 days after claiming:</h4>
        <p>You decide to return the rewards 100 days after you claimed (200 days consumed of your Hex stake). 
            The return amount is HXR calculated as follows:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> (200 days consumed of stake) × 0.00001 HXR/day = 0.002 HXR</li>
            <li><strong>Return Amount:</strong> 0.002 HXR + (30% of 0.002 HXR) = 0.0026 HXR</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    
    <h2>Final Claim</h2>
    <h3>5.1 Final Claim - "Good Accounting"</h3>
        <p>Upon completing the full 1000-day stake: 
            First call the "Good Accounting" function for the stake on Hex.com website. 
            Then the final claim reward is calculated as a 10x bonus:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Calculation:</strong> (1000 days consumed × 0.00001 HXR/day) × 10 = 0.1 HXR</li>            
        </ul>

    <h2>Continuous Interaction</h2>
    <h3>6.1 Continuous Interaction</h3>
        <p>Flexibility: The "Claim", "Return", and "Claim" cycle can be repeated an unlimited number of times 
            for the same stake, as long as it is active (not ended), allowing you to optimize your reward strategy
            based on stake progress and changes in your investment approach.</p>
   
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
